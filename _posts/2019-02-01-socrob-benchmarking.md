Under a research grant, implemented robotic benchmarks for [European Robotics League](https://eu-robotics.net/eurobotics/activities/european-robotics-league/) competitions, and for [eurobench](https://eurobench2020.eu/) - a proposal for bipedal robot testing facilities.

I was also part of the [SocRob team](https://irsgroup.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/socrob/) in ISR Lisbon, working on a domestic robot to help elderly and low-mobility people. Our team took part in competitions for domestic robots.
